## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- **Being accountable** — Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on community benefit** — Prioritizing what is best for the overall community
- **Supporting newcomers** — Helping new contributors get started and feel welcome
- **Respecting differing viewpoints** — Acknowledging that people have different perspectives and experiences

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- **GitHub repository** — Issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
- **Communication channels** — Any official communication platforms
- **Events** — Online or offline events organized by the community
- **Public representation** — When an individual is officially representing the community

Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: [conduct@banglacode.dev](mailto:conduct@banglacode.dev)
- **GitHub**: Open a private security advisory or contact maintainers directly

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

We will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Details of specific enforcement actions may not be shared publicly unless the situation warrants it.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for BanglaCode

### Language and Cultural Sensitivity

BanglaCode serves the Bengali-speaking community worldwide. We expect all community members to:

- **Respect linguistic diversity** — Be patient with non-native English speakers and those learning programming
- **Welcome beginners** — Remember that our target audience includes students who are new to programming
- **Avoid assumptions** — Don't assume everyone has the same technical background or access to resources
- **Be culturally aware** — Respect cultural differences within the global Bengali community

### Educational Focus

As a language designed for education:

- **Encourage learning** — Help others learn rather than criticizing their mistakes
- **Share knowledge** — Contribute to documentation, tutorials, and examples
- **Be patient** — Remember that everyone was a beginner once
- **Celebrate progress** — Acknowledge improvements and achievements, no matter how small
